# JavaScript and Classes
    In JavaScript, prototypes are the mechanism by which objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning that inheritance is achieved by linking objects to other objects rather than using classes (as in class-based languages).

    Yes, JavaScript has the concept of classes, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015. Although JavaScript is a prototype-based language, classes provide a more familiar syntax for object-oriented programming, similar to other languages like Python or Java.

## object
    - collection of propeties and method
    - eg:promises

## why use oops
    We use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it provides a structured way of organizing code that makes it more scalable, maintainable, and reusable. OOP helps address common issues like code duplication, lack of structure, and difficulty in managing larger codebases. When used properly, OOP can make your code easier to understand, extend, and maintain over time.

## parts of oops
    - object literal:An object literal in JavaScript is a simple and concise way to create objects using a pair of curly braces {} to define properties and methods directly. It is the most common way to create objects in JavaScript.

-   constructor
-   prototype
-   classes
-   Instance(new,this)
